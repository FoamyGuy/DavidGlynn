Inside XMLPullParser.java:
    Changed TITLE variable from "name" to "title"
    Changed LINK variable from "urlLink" to "link"
    Changed ENCLOSURE variable from "imageFile" to "enclosure"
    Add null check on curItem when parsing xml. If curItem is null it means we haven't starting parsing the first <item> yet (i.e. we are reading channel elements instead of item elements.)
    change `curItem.setEnclosure(curText);` to `curItem.setLink(curText);` in the if (tagname.equalsIgnoreCase(LINK)) code block.
    Add a new if statement to the START_TAG section to check for enclosure and pull out the url attribute value.
